### Data Processing
#### Select meaningful features

##### Sequential backward selection (SBS)
Sequential backward selection (SBS) is a feature selection algorithm that iteratively removes features from the dataset until a desired number of features is reached. It is a greedy algorithm that works by iteratively removing the least important feature until a desired number of features is reached.

**Step-by-Step Process of SBS Algorithm**

1. Start with All Features
2. Define Evaluation Metric: define an evaluation metric to measure the quality of a subset of features
3. Iterative Elimination
   - 
4. Repeat Until Desired Number of Features is Reached
