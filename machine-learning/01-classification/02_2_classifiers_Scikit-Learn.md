## Classifiers Using Scikit-Learn

#### Choosing a classification algorithm
The five main steps that are involved in training a supervised machine learning algorithm can be summarized as follows:
1. Selecting features and collecting labeled training examples
2. Choosing a performance metric
3. Choosing a learning algorithm and training a model
4. Evaluating the performance of the model
5. Changing the settings of the algorithm and tuning the model.
